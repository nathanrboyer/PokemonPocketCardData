# Pokemon Pocket Card Data
A [notebook](https://plutojl.org/)
for visual filtering of [Pokemon Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) card data.
Its main function is to provide information on which card packs to open
based on which cards you desire.
**[CLICK HERE](https://nathanrboyer.github.io/PokemonPocketCardData/)**
to preview the notebook.
Then click the button in the top-right corner to download and edit it.

(Usually the presented Binder cloud option is unusably slow,
so you will want to follow the instructions to run the notebook locally.)

*Thanks to [Chase Manning](https://github.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards)
for providing the card database.*
