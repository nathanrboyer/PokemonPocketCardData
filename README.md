# Pokemon Pocket Card Data
A [Notebook](https://plutojl.org/)
for visual filtering of [Pokemon Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) card data.
Its main function is to provide information on which card packs you should open
based on which cards you are missing.
Click on [this link](https://nathanrboyer.github.io/PokemonPocketCardData/)
to open the notebook.
Then click the button in the top right corner to run and edit it.
(It will run significantly faster with a local installation of [Julia](https://julialang.org/) .)
Enter your desired card numbers in each series in the "Input" section
to filter the database.

*Thanks to [Chase Manning](https://github.com/chase-manning/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards)
for providing the card database.*
